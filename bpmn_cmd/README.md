splunk-sdk-python eventingsearchcommands_app example
========================================

Eventing/Dataset processing commands require the entire dataset in place before the command can run. These commands are not transforming, not distributable, not streaming, and not orchestrating. Some of these commands fit into other types in specific situations or when specific arguments are used.

Applies a transformation to search results as they travel through the events pipeline.

Eventing commands typically filter, group, order, and/or or augment event records. Examples of eventing commands from Splunkâ€™s built-in command set include sort, dedup, and cluster. Each execution of an eventing command should produce a set of event records that is independently usable by downstream processors.


This app provides an example of Eventing Custom search commands which will only returns events having a same status mentioned in query.
